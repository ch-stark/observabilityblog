## Simplified Configuration with T-Shirt Sizing

RHACM Observability simplifies setup by employing "T-Shirt sizing" for configurations. This approach ensures optimal tuning of the following components for scalability and efficiency:

* RBAC Query Proxy
* Grafana (Perses in the future)
* Alertmanager
* Observatorium API
* Thanos (Query Frontend, Query, Compact, Receive, Rule, Rule Reloader, Store, Store Memcached) â€“ soon shipped as an Operator for better configuration
* Memcached Exporter
* Observatorium Receive Controller

## Comprehensive Metric Resource Utilization and Planning

RHACM provides detailed insights into resource consumption, offering metrics like `TOTAL in MilliCPUs` and `TOTAL in CPUs`. This transparency helps customers plan and allocate resources effectively. Furthermore, our **rightsizing dashboards** provide recommendations to optimize your resource utilization, leading to cost savings and improved performance.
