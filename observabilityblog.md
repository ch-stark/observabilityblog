## Proven Scalable and Highly Available Monitoring Setup

RHACM Observability is architected to manage vast metric datasets, demonstrated by its capability to support customers with **over 150 million series of metrics**. This capacity ensures consistent performance across the largest deployments, effectively overcoming the inherent retention limitations of standalone OpenShift monitoring. Its high-availability design incorporates metric data replication between stores, preventing data loss and ensuring continuous operational insightsâ€”a critical factor for business continuity in enterprise settings.

## Simplified Configuration with T-Shirt Sizing and Thanos Optimization

RHACM Observability streamlines deployment and configuration through a "T-Shirt sizing" methodology, which pre-tunes core components for optimal scalability and efficiency. A pivotal element within this architecture is **Thanos**, an open-source, highly scalable observability platform for storing, querying, and visualizing Prometheus metrics across distributed environments. Thanos is crucial for achieving long-term data retention, global querying capabilities, and high availability in large-scale setups.

The components optimized include:

* RBAC Query Proxy
* Grafana (with future alignment to Perses)
* Alertmanager
* Observatorium API
* **Thanos**: This suite of components (Query Frontend, Query, Compact, Receive, Rule, Rule Reloader, Store, Store Memcached) is the backbone of RHACM Observability's scalability and long-term retention. Its role is paramount for handling the immense volume of metrics and enabling efficient querying across disparate Prometheus instances. RHACM's future plans include shipping Thanos as a dedicated Operator for enhanced, simplified configuration and management.
    * **Thanos Tuning for Scale**: For large-scale deployments, optimizing Thanos components is crucial. Key considerations for performance and efficiency include:
        * **Thanos Compactor**: This component is responsible for data compaction and downsampling, which drastically reduces storage costs and improves query performance for historical data. Careful configuration of retention policies (e.g., raw data for 90 days, 5-minute resolution for 180 days, 1-hour resolution for 1 year) is essential. Ensuring the Compactor is actively processing blocks is critical, and alerts should be configured to detect any stoppage.
        * **Thanos Query Frontend**: Acts as a caching layer and query splitter, significantly improving the performance of complex and long-range PromQL queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. Effective caching, often via Memcached, is vital.
        * **Thanos Store Gateway**: Provides a read-only interface to the object storage where metrics are stored. For very large datasets, sharding the Store Gateway based on time ranges can distribute the query load and improve retrieval times.
        * **Thanos Receive**: When used for remote write, proper tuning of `batch_send_deadline` and backoff settings helps manage ingestion load and prevent overloading the receiver, especially during restarts or high churn. Choosing between `hashmod` and `ketama` for hashring distribution impacts churn during scaling operations.
        * **Metric Cardinality and Retention**: Aggressively pruning unnecessary metrics and managing high-cardinality labels directly impacts Thanos's performance and storage footprint. Only essential metrics should be retained for long periods, with appropriate downsampling applied to older data.
* Memcached Exporter
* Observatorium Receive Controller
